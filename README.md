# Powerpuff Girls web app created by Anthoula Alipasali

This is a web application for showing the Powerpuff Girls movie, and it's episodes for each season.
The data are retrieved from the TV Maze REST API.
I used React-Router for the navigation of the app, and Redux-Thunk for manupulating the store.

To get started you need to go to your terminal, find powerpuff-girls project and in the root of the project run `npm install`, and then `npm run start`.
Then go to your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`

To run the tests enter `npm test` into your terminal.
